Windows User Note: Bash isn't performing good with mongo shell environment, so prefer cmd for now.

# To open a mongo shell environment.
mongo


#show all dbs
show dbs


#To select db (or create **new db** if doesn't exist)
use test1


#shows currently selected db name
db


#Show the collections of currently selected db.
show collections


#creates new collection 'posts' in currently selected db.
db.createCollection('posts')


#Drop a collection named `mycollection`
use myDb # Select a database
db.mycollection.drop() # Drop collection.


# Dropping a db:
use myDb # Select a database
db.dropDatabase() # Drop selected database.
