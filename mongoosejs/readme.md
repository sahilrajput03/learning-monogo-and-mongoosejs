- You should always use pluras names, otherwise mongodb will itself change the name to plurals. Yikes!

- (Usage of collection name as person(gets translated to `people` lol), user gets translated to `users`, people gets translated to `peoples` )

- Good collection names: `users`, `persons`

Tip: db.mycollection.drop() to drop a collection.

FInd /?????

drop a collection with mongoose!
