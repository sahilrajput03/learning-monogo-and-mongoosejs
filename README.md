## You can create mongodb object ids from plain text as well

## Clearing collections (can be used for better test without sideeffects)

```js
import { Connection } from 'mongoose';

export const dropCollections = async (connection: Connection) => {
  await Promise.all(
    (await connection.db.collections()).map((collection) => collection.deleteMany({})),
  );
};
```

## Executing js files with mongodb

```js
// switch to database
use imdb;

// firstly we have to clean up potential remainders
db.dropDatabase();

// create admin user
db.createUser({
user: 'imdb',
pwd: 'simple',
roles: [{ role: 'dbOwner', db:'imdb'}]
});
```

## `$within`?

This is for checking a point lies in given shape with given values of its edges and coordinates. (Not at all useful to check if a coordinate exists in 10kms range of another coordinate point on earth).

Sourc: [Click here](https://mongodb-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/operator/within.html#gsc.tab=0)

Also, `$geoWithin` works in similar way. Source: [Click here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/)

## To share with Eric

Even with this `$near` operator mongodb doesn't support calculating distance b/w two coordinates. We would need to use some custom logic or some third party lib to get approx distance.

## Finding distance between two gps locations (point to point and not the actual travelling distance by roads)

**Source: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbge8Psdyrw)**

*Also: In case you wanna calculate distance using Haversine formula: [Stackoverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928/calculate-distance-between-two-latitude-longitude-points-haversine-formula/27943#27943)*

Docs: $geoNear: [version4.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.0/reference/operator/aggregation/geoNear/#pipe._S_geoNear), [ver6-latest](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/geoNear/)

Docs: [Geospatial Queries](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.0/geospatial-queries/)

I managed to calculate distance b/w two gps locations and returning the docs in nearest first order with just mongo's geospatial utils. ALSO: I tested with my nearby locations as well, it seemed to work for me.

Find this code in `mongo-shell-with-watcher` folder, yikes! **TESTED with my custom gps locations as well. Yikes!!**
