## ‚ù§Ô∏è `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` in mongoose

Docs: [Click here](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#serverselectiontimeoutms)

Recently used in repo - [andorid-loop](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/android-loop)

_Below text is from above mongoose docs link._

The serverSelectionTimeoutMS option is extremely important: it controls how long the MongoDB Node.js driver will attempt to retry any operation before erroring out. This includes initial connection, like await mongoose.connect(), as well as any operations that make requests to MongoDB, like save() or find().

By default, serverSelectionTimeoutMS is 30000 (30 seconds). This means that, for example, if you call mongoose.connect() when your standalone MongoDB server is down, your mongoose.connect() call will only throw an error after 30 seconds.

```js
// Throws an error "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND doesnt.exist" after 30 seconds
await mongoose.connect('mongodb://doesnt.exist:27017/test')
```

Similarly, if your standalone MongoDB server goes down after initial connection, any find() or save() calls will error out after 30 seconds, unless your MongoDB server is restarted.

While 30 seconds seems like a long time, serverSelectionTimeoutMS means you're unlikely to see any interruptions during a replica set failover. If you lose your replica set primary, the MongoDB Node driver will ensure that any operations you send during the replica set election will eventually execute, assuming that the replica set election takes less than serverSelectionTimeoutMS.

To get faster feedback on failed connections, you can reduce serverSelectionTimeoutMS to 5000 as follows. We don't recommend reducing serverSelectionTimeoutMS unless you are running a standalone MongoDB server rather than a replica set, or unless you are using a serverless runtime like AWS Lambda.

```js
mongoose.connect(uri, {
	serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000,
})
```

There is no way to tune serverSelectionTimeoutMS independently for mongoose.connect() vs for queries. If you want to reduce serverSelectionTimeoutMS for queries and other operations, but still retry mongoose.connect() for longer, you are responsible for retrying the connect() calls yourself using a for loop or a tool like p-retry.

```
const serverSelectionTimeoutMS = 5000;

// Prints "Failed 0", "Failed 1", "Failed 2" and then throws an
// error. Exits after approximately 15 seconds.
for (let i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect('mongodb://doesnt.exist:27017/test', {
      serverSelectionTimeoutMS
    });
    break;
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('Failed', i);
    if (i >= 2) {
      throw err;
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è Avoid duplicate references when creating relationships

~ Written by Sahil Rajput.

When you want to reference between two collections you can store the id of the 1st document in second document only (no need to store id of second document in first Documents). Now when you need second document you can avoid using populate of the first document and rather make a separate query on second collection e.g. `secondCollection.find({ userId: "..."})`. Also for the reverse query i e., to get linked first document from the second document ‚Äî you have userId field in the second document itself.

This way we avoid making redundant reference in documents of the first collection and also achieve the goal to visually see what the second document is linked to by directly looking at documents of the second collection.

Also, .populate() internally makes two queries just like we would manually query to the second collection to get the item using the id stored on that field.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Database schema for Google User details? (Claude and ChatGPT)

_What is better?_

_- having google user data to a nested field in mongodb or_
_- having separate collection for google-users and link them to users collection._

_Be concise._

**From ChatGPT:**

- **Having a separate collection for Google users and linking it to the users collection is better. It ensures better scalability, normalization, and easier management of relationships while avoiding duplication of data.**

**‚ù§Ô∏èFrom Claude:**

- **For most applications, having a separate collection for Google users is better because:**
  - **1. It maintains cleaner data separation and schema flexibility**
  - **2. Enables easier querying of Google-specific data**
  - **3. Follows MongoDB's principle of embedding vs referencing - reference when data can change independently or needs to be queried independently**

**Use embedded nested fields only if the Google data is simple, rarely changes, and is always queried together with the user data.**

## What does `.populate()` do in mongoose? Is it natively from mongodb driver? What does it do behind the scenes? (ChatGPT)

In Mongoose, `.populate()` is a powerful method used to automatically replace a referenced document ID with the actual document data from another collection. This feature simplifies working with related data in Mongo

What does `.populate()` do in Mongoose?

`.populate()` in Mongoose is a method used to perform data lookup. It replaces references (e.g., `ObjectIDs`) in a document with the actual documents from another collection. This is particularly useful when working with relational data structures in MongoDB. For example:

Suppose you have two collections: `users` and `posts`. A post may reference a user through a `userId`. Using `.populate()`, you can retrieve the complete user document when querying posts.

Example:

```js
const post = await Post.findById(postId).populate('author')
// Now, `post.author` contains the user document instead of just the ID.
```

Is `.populate()` natively from MongoDB driver?

No, `.populate()` is not part of the native MongoDB driver. It is a feature of Mongoose, an ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB. The native MongoDB driver does not provide this functionality. Instead, you would need to perform a manual join-like operation using multiple queries and combine the data programmatically.

What does `.populate()` do behind the scenes?
Under the hood, `.populate()` performs the following steps:

1. **Identify the referenced field:** Mongoose examines the schema to find the field to populate (e.g., author in the example above).

2. **Perform a separate query:** Mongoose makes an additional query to the referenced collection (e.g., users) to fetch the related documents. This query is performed based on the ObjectID or the reference specified in the original document.

For instance:

```js
const user = await User.findById(post.author)
```

3. **Merge the data:** The results of the separate query are merged into the original document, replacing the reference with the actual data.

After population, you get something like this:

```js
{
    "_id": "postId",
    "title": "My Post",
    "author": {
        "_id": "userId",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
    }
}
```

4. Handle options like filtering and projection (if specified):
   You can pass additional options to control how .populate() behaves:

```js
Post.findById(postId).populate({
	path: 'author',
	select: 'name email',
})
```

**_Key Notes:_**

1. Performance:
   Each .populate() call results in an additional query to the database. This can lead to performance issues for large or deeply nested relationships. Use judiciously.

2. Lean queries: If you use .lean() with .populate(), you still get the populated documents, but they are plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents.

3. Virtual populate: Mongoose also supports virtual population, where references are not explicitly stored in the database but resolved dynamically using query logic.

Example:

```js
userSchema.virtual('posts', {
	ref: 'Post',
	localField: '_id',
	foreignField: 'author',
})

// now we can make below query and it works magically
User.findById(userId).populate('posts')
```

`.populate()` simplifies working with related data in MongoDB by abstracting the process of manually fetching and combining related documents.

## What is virtual populate in mongoose? Give example. be concise. (ChatGPT)

In Mongoose, virtual populate is a feature that lets you set up virtual fields in your schema to populate related documents without storing references directly in the database. It works by dynamically pulling related data based on specified criteria.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

// Define schemas
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
	name: String,
})

const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
	title: String,
	content: String,
	author: {
		type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
		ref: 'User', // For regular populate
	},
})

// Add virtual field to User schema
userSchema.virtual('posts', {
	ref: 'Post', // Related model
	localField: '_id', // Field in User model
	foreignField: 'author', // Field in Post model
})

// Enable virtuals in JSON output
userSchema.set('toJSON', {virtuals: true})
userSchema.set('toObject', {virtuals: true})

// Models
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)
const Post = mongoose.model('Post', postSchema)

// Usage
;(async () => {
	const user = await User.findOne().populate('posts')
	console.log(user.posts) // Virtual populate
})()
```

**Key Points:**

- Virtuals are not stored in the database.
- They are computed dynamically based on relationships.
- Useful for simplifying queries without duplicating references.

## Piyush's Project vs. Slasher's Project

- In piyush's project, we got `userSchema.pre('save', () => {...})` method and it updates `password` field to be hashed i.e., `User.create({ password: 'plain-text'})` automatically saved password to hash. This is cool, and the current note-zipper project has the implementation for the `userFactory`. The big difference b/w `userFactory` of piyush's project and slasher project is that slasher's project uses transient properties which is not needed at all when we have auto hashing of passwords set on the schema.
- In slasher's project, we have defiend custom schema methods i.e, `UserSchema.methods.setUnhashedPassword = () => {...}` which works like below:

```js
const user = new User(userRegisterDto)
// set the hashed password manually on the user document
user.setUnhashedPassword(userRegisterDto.password)
// needed to updated in db
await userDetails.save()
```

## Does validation message plays any role when `required: false` (tldr: no)

```js
// schema:
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: [false, 'Please Enter Your Password'],
    minLength: [8, 'Password should be greater than 8 characters'],
    select: false,
  },
```

```js
// password field is only retrieved when explicitly asked for like below
const user = await User.findOne({email}).select('+password')
```

## Validatation using mongoose data

```bash
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// This is useful for simple validation on APIs
async function validateUser() {
  const newUser = new User({
    username: 'john_doe',
    email: 'john.doe@email.com'
  });

  try {
    await newUser.validate();
    console.log('Data is valid!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
}

validateUser();
```

## How can a store documents such that I can fetch them in a particular sequence

Query: For e.g., we have a 10 classes in a school, then each class has students with defined roll numbers to them in ascending order. So, we need to fetch list of students in a particular order only, in other words we need to maintain their order/sequence.

Solution:

1. Use a Sequence Field: Add a `sequence` field to your documents that represents the order or sequence of the documents. When you retrieve documents, you can use this field to sort them in the desired sequence. When retrieving documents, you can use .sort({ "sequence": 1 }) to get them in ascending order.
   ```js
   {
     "_id": ObjectId("documentId"),
     "name": "Document Name",
     "sequence": 1
     // Other document fields
   }
   ```
2. Maintain an External List in your class document for e.g., `rollNumbers: [studentId1, studentId2, and so on...]` that represents the desired sequence. When you need to retrieve documents in a specific order, you can fetch the list of IDs and then retrieve the documents based on this list. This approach allows you to change the order without modifying the documents themselves. However, it requires additional management of the order list.

## `maxTimeMS` (sems like it doesn't work though)

[chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/910c0308-a8dd-49bd-9089-e95f946119cb)

![image](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/learning-monogo-and-mongoosejs/assets/31458531/215802a2-315f-4dc6-88e9-8474eedd440c)

```js
    const doc of moviesModel
      .find({ deleted: MovieDeletionStatus.NotDeleted })
      .cursor({ maxTimeMS: 5000 })
  ) {
    // doc
  }

```

## Using `.exists()` method to check if one or more documents match with a given filter

Note: `Model.exists(filter)` returns `{ _id: id_of_first_matched_document } | null`.

```ts
async podcastUrlIsAvailable(podcastUrl: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const podcastExists = await this.podcastsModel.exists({ rssUrl: podcastUrl });
  return !podcastExists;
}
```

Short notes:

1. Default is ascending order ie., `sort: 1`
2. Providing `sort: -1` to get in descending order.

## Getting all collecion names

```ts
// getting names of all models
const mongooseModelsNames = connection.modelNames()

// getting all models as an array
const mongooseModels = connection
	.modelNames()
	.map((modelName) => connection.model(modelName))
```

## On demand creating an index for a collection

```ts
;(await connection.db.collections())
	.find((collection) => collection.collectionName === 'events')
	.createIndex({location: '2dsphere'})
```

			type: String,
			enum: ['Point'],
			required: true,
		},
		coordinates: {
			type: [Number],
			required: true,

## ‚ô• ‚ù£‚ô• ‚ù£‚ô• ‚ù£ `findOneAndUpdate` is best and how to use from the maintainer itself

- MongoDb Docs: [findOneAndUpdate](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.findOneAndUpdate/)
- MongooseJs: [How to Use findOneAndUpdate() in Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/findoneandupdate.html)
- Source: [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59491047/10012446)

```ts
// creating new document if already doesn't exist (note: we're passing {} as second coz we just want a new document with required fields (search fields in 1st argument)
await this.feedReplyLikeModel.findOneAndUpdate({ feedReplyId, userId }, {}, { upsert: true, new: true });


const doc = await Contact.findOneAndUpdate(
  { phone: request.phone},
  { status: request.status },
  { upsert: true, new: true }
);


# Comment from here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/7486950/10012446
# I don't think you need the {$set: ... } part here as its automatic form my reading
# ~Sahil: People use $set as well:
const doc = await Contact.findOneAndUpdate(
  { phone: request.phone},
  { $set: { status: request.status } },
  { upsert: true, new: true }
);
```

### LEARN: ‚ô• ‚ù£‚ô• ‚ù£‚ô• Difference between `upsert: true` and `new: true`. Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44794886

```txt
They are completely different flags
- If upsert is true then if the row trying to be updated does not exist then a new row is inserted instead , if false then it does not do anything .
- If new is true then the modified document is returned after the update rather than the original , if false then the original document is returned
```

## Usage of `$exists`

- Source: [Mongoplayground](https://mongoplayground.net/)
- Docs: [$exists](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/exists/)

Without `$exists`:

```bash
# Collection
[{"key": 1,car: 10},{"key": 2}]

# Query
db.collection.aggregate([{$match: {car: {$ne: 20}}}])

# Output:
[
  {"_id": ObjectId("5a934e000102030405000000"),"car": 10,"key": 1},
  {"_id": ObjectId("5a934e000102030405000001"),"key": 2}
]
```

With `$exists`:

```bash
# Collection
[{"key": 1,car: 10},{"key": 2}]

# Query
db.collection.aggregate([{$match: {car: {$exists: true, $ne: 20}}}])

# Output (notice that field which has no `car` key is not returned):
[
  {"_id": ObjectId("5a934e000102030405000000"),"car": 10,"key": 1},
]
```

## We can use `$count` to count documents easily in aggregate

with mongoose you can do like: `const ratingUsersCount = await this.movieUserStatusModel.count({ movieId, rating: { $exists: true, $ne: 0 } });`

Source: [Mongoplayground](https://mongoplayground.net/)

**Using `$count` in aggregate: [Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/count/)**

Similarly:

- db.collection.count(): [Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.count/)
- db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount(): [Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount/)

```bash
# Documents
[
  {"_id": 400, movieId: 200},
  {"_id": 500,movieId: 200},
  {"_id": 600,movieId: 300}
]

# Query
db.collection.aggregate([
  {"$match": {movieId: 200}},
  {"$count": "totaItems"}
])

# Output
[{"totaItems": 2}]
```

## we can execute multiple queries with using `$facet`

Using `$facet`: [Click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52913008/mongodb-execute-multiple-queries-in-one-round-trip)

But this is a issue that I faced myself and seems there's no such fix for this werid behaviour: [Click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54128630/mongodb-aggregation-slow-count-using-facet)

## useful `updateOne` method

_Drawback:_

- We don't get created/updated document, so we need fo to make a `findOne` query explcitly
- Do not rely on returned value i.e, `value.upsertedId` as this is only preset if document is created (not returned when its updated)

```ts
// its useful as it creates the record with necessary values if it already doesn't exist
await this.movieUserStatusModel.updateOne(
	{movieId, userId},
	{$set: {rating}},
	{upsert: true}
)
```

## Thats how we do transactions with mongoose

_Transactions are new in MongoDB 4.0 and Mongoose 5.2.0. Transactions let you execute multiple operations in isolation and potentially undo all the operations if one of them fails. This guide will get you started using transactions with Mongoose._

## Order of array while searching matters

That means if you use wrong order then the query will not match the document:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31458531/211662275-dd65edd2-7ea9-4819-bb2e-b9f641655bca.png)

## Cursor in mongodb, Iterate over documents individualy using stream

- Amazing - Mongodb Docs: [Click here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/iterate-a-cursor/)

- Stackoverflow Question: [Click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56741578/mongoose-cursors-with-many-documents-and-load)

Q. **(Please see ChatGPT's awesome explanations below as well)** Why cursor and not batches (i.e, `limit()` way)? **Ans.** Using the skip feature when iterating through results in batches can get slower over time for large data sets, when skip is given a high numeric value, so streaming with a cursor helps to get around that. ~Credits: Eric

This is for checking a point lies in given shape with given values of its edges and coordinates. (Not at all useful to check if a coordinate exists in 10kms range of another coordinate point on earth).

Sourc: [Click here](https://mongodb-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/operator/within.html#gsc.tab=0)

Also, `$geoWithin` works in similar way. Source: [Click here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/)

## To share with Eric

Even with this `$near` operator mongodb doesn't support calculating distance b/w two coordinates. We would need to use some custom logic or some third party lib to get approx distance.

## Finding distance between two gps locations (point to point and not the actual travelling distance by roads)

_Also: In case you wanna calculate distance using Haversine formula: [Stackoverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928/calculate-distance-between-two-latitude-longitude-points-haversine-formula/27943#27943)_

Docs: $geoNear: [version4.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.0/reference/operator/aggregation/geoNear/#pipe._S_geoNear), [ver6-latest](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/geoNear/)

Docs: [Geospatial Queries](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.0/geospatial-queries/)

I managed to calculate distance b/w two gps locations and returning the docs in nearest first order with just mongo's geospatial utils. ALSO: I tested with my nearby locations as well, it seemed to work for me.

Find this code in `mongo-shell-with-watcher` folder, yikes! **TESTED with my custom gps locations as well. Yikes!!**
